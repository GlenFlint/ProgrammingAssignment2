## This example uses the <<- operator which can be used to assign a value to an object in an environment that is different from the current environment.
## Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a numeric matrix and cache's its inverse.

## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to
##    set the value of the matrix
##    get the value of the matrix
##    set the value of the inverse
##    get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        inv <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setInverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
        getInverse <- function() inv
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setInverse = setInverse,
             getInverse = getInverse)
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "vector" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setInverse function.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        
        inv <- x$getInverse()
        if(!is.null(inv)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(inv)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        inv <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setInverse(inv)
        inv
}
